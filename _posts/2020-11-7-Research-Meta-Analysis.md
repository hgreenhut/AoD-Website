## Are chess players smarter than non-chess players? A meta-analysis. ##
[Research Paper](https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S0160289616301635?token=86F16125186C1BCBE67F2AC68C7B2045B53E7FC4460912DA075BB7907886111FE9D2599887B22BDF3B42219A463205F7&originRegion=us-east-1&originCreation=20221106213613)

1. What are the null and alternative hypotheses?
<br/>
Null hypothesis: There is no correlation between playing chess and intelligence
<br/>
Alternative hypotheses: Chess players are generally more or less intelligent than non-chess players

2. Who is collecting and analyzing this data?
<br/>
This study is a meta-analysis of seven other studies which compare some intelligence metric between chess-players and non-chess players. The meta-analysis is done by six university graduates: Giovanni Sala, Alexander P. Burgoyne, Brooke N. Macnamara, David Z. Hambrick, Guillermo Campitelli, and Fernand Gobet. They reference the studies by the name of their primary researchers, such as Anderson, and Doll and Mayr, but it is unclear who is physically collecting the data.
<br/>
3. What datasets does this study reference or use? Are these datasets available to the public?
<br/>
This paper analyses seven studies conducted between 1987 and 2016. Each of these studies created their own data by administering intelligence tests to chess players & non-chess players. All of the data is available to the public, although most is behind a paywall.
<br/>

4. Why are they interested in this data?
<br/>
The overarching question that drives this meta-analysis is whether experts are inherently more intellegent than non-experts; or, whether experts tend to score higher on intelligence tests simplybecause to become an expert, you often first have to do well on tests to recieve training in the first place (ex. University students have to score well on standardized tests to be admitted to schools and then become experts). Chess is the chosen subject-matter because there are no intelligence tests you have to pass to learn chess & become an expert.
<br/>
5. What data is being recorded? What data might be left out?
<br/>
The criteria to be included in the meta-analysis was that the study must compare chess-players and non-chess players, must administer some test of intelligence, and must contain enough data to calculate an effect size. The chess players ranged from middle schoolers to chess masters.

<br/>
6. What evidence did they present to back up their conclusions?

7. How was this study funded?
$12 compensation
8. Do you think publish or perish had an effect on this study?
