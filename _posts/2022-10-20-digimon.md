** Opening the digimon file
```python
with open("datasets/digimon.csv", "r") as f:
    data = csv.DictReader(f)
    data = list(data)
```
I type casted the dict reader into a list so it could be reused.

** Average Speed

To determine the average speed of the digimon, I had to figure out how many digimon there were and the combined speeds of all the digimon.

To do this, I created a dictionary that tracked the total count and speed of the digimon. Then, I looped through all the digimon, incrementing the count by one and the speed by the digimon's speed.

At the end, I divided the total speed by the count to determine the average speed. I rounded it to three decimal places.

```python
def get_average_speed():
    speed = {"Count": 0, "Total Speed": 0}
    for row in data:
        speed["Count"] += 1
        speed["Total Speed"] += int(row["Spd"])
    averageSpeed = round(speed["Total Speed"]/speed["Count"], 3)
    return "The average speed is " + str(averageSpeed)
```




Here's a useless table:

| Number | Next number | Previous number |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| Five | Six | Four |
| Ten | Eleven | Nine |
| Seven | Eight | Six |
| Two | Three | One |


How about a yummy crepe?

![Crepe](https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cQ1Yoa75m2yUFFbY2xwuqw/348s.jpg)

It can also be centered!

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}

## Boxes

### Notification

{: .box-note}
**Note:** This is a notification box.

### Warning

{: .box-warning}
**Warning:** This is a warning box.

### Error
