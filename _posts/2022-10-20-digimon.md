**Opening the digimon file** 
```python
with open("datasets/digimon.csv", "r") as f:
    data = csv.DictReader(f)
    data = list(data)
```
I type casted the dict reader into a list so it could be reused.

**Average Speed**

To determine the average speed of the digimon, I had to figure out how many digimon there were and the combined speeds of all the digimon.

To do this, I created a dictionary that tracked the total count and speed of the digimon. 
```python
speed = {"Count": 0, "Total Speed": 0}
```
Then, I looped through all the digimon, incrementing the count by one and the speed by the digimon's speed.
```python
for row in data:
    speed["Count"] += 1
    speed["Total Speed"] += int(row["Spd"])
```
At the end, I divided the total speed by the count to determine the average speed. I rounded it to three decimal places.
```python
averageSpeed = round(speed["Total Speed"]/speed["Count"], 3)
```

**Count Attribute**

I looped through all of the digimon. When a matching column had a matching value, I incremented my count variable.
```python
if row[column] == attribute:
            count += 1
```

**Team Recruitor -- Find Group of Digimon that Fit Constraints**

I wanted to create a function that would allow you to efficiently find a matching group of digimon when given: the maximum memory allowed, the minimum attack allowed, and the maximum team members.

First, I looped through the digimon file to collect relevant information. I only included digimon within the maximum memory:
```python
if int(row["Memory"]) <= int(max_memory):
```
If a digimon had sufficient attack to meet the requirements alone, I just returned information about that digimon:
```python
if int(row["Atk"]) >= int(min_attack):
```
I appended information about each digimon's attack, memory, and number into a nested list:
```python
 atk.append([int(row["Atk"]), int(row["Memory"]), int(row["Number"])])
```
Then I built a function to sort the nested list highest to lowest by the digimon with the most attack per memory (source - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sort-in-python/):
```python
def attack_per_memory(elem):
    return elem[0]/elem[1]
atk.sort(key = attack_per_memory, reverse=True)
```





How about a yummy crepe?

It can also be centered!

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}

## Boxes
You can add notification, warning and error boxes like this:

### Notification

{: .box-note}
**Note:** This is a notification box.

### Warning

{: .box-warning}
**Warning:** This is a warning box.

### Error

{: .box-error}
**Error:** This is an error box.
