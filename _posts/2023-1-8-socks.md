**STEP 1: Creating the sock dataset**

To create the sock dataset, first I had to access a sock api using my key as a paremeter. The api works by responding with information about the sock whose index is specified as a paremeter in the request. The problem is that I didn't know the total number of socks, and therefore didn't know which indexes to request.

So, I build a while loop that, starting from 0 and increasing by 1, requests every sock until it does not receive a valid response. 
Every request will have will have the same base url: https://afeingoldhm.pythonanywhere.com/socks?key=****************&idx= (replace astericks with your own key).
