It was another cold, hazy Friday morning in 2017. My wallet was packed deep in my right pocket, filled with $1 bills in eager preparation for the bake sale later in the day. I boarded the 1 train, finding a seat in the back of the car. I stood as the train screeched to a halt at 110, swiftly moving toward the doors. As the doors closed behind me, I felt for my wallet. Nothing.

I've taken the uptown 1 train every school morning for the past 12 years. I've ridden in the same cars so many times, that I've on multiple occations recognized a crack in the paint or a sticker on the wall from a previous ride. So many times, that I wouldn't have known how to calculate it when I had first started. Multiplying the 160 days of school by the 12 years of school I've gone through, and then adding in the numerous other times I've ridden the subway, I've been on the 1 train around 2,000 times.

My wallet isn't the only item I've lost to the jaws of the New York City subway. In fact, I lost my third metrocard last week. And I'm not alone:

Underneath Penn Station lies the MTA's lost and found. Items found on public transportation by MTA employees or good samaritans are sent there to await a claim. For years, the MTA maintained a public, online database of the items stored in the lost in found. As of 2018, there were 751,622 items, but after 2018, they stopped updating the live database.

The MTA sorts the lost items into a range of categories, from Musical Instruments to Footwear.

With hundreds of thousands of items left without a home, I wondered, how much was it all worth? How much does the thoughtlessness of the patrons of the New York City subway system cost us each year? But I don't want to spend time estimating the value of the 9 harmonicas or the 168 walkie talkies abandoned to the clutches of the MTA. So, who better to ask how much each item is worth than Amazon?

30for30 - 168,478 items in 2014

new york times - 8,000 per year


video says 30,000 items each year, 18% go back to owners
calculate # of times i've taken the 1 train

and through all of those bleary mornings, i've also had some belongings fall victim. A wallet and 3 metrocards.

And I'm not alone,

new yorkers do care for their expensive stuff, which make sense, but that does not explain the 13 lost saxophones
