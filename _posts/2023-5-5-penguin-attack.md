Tired of being the victim of data analysis problems, the Penguins decide there is only one thing to do: seige the earth.


Penguins aren't historically the most dangerous of creatures. In fact, throughout human history, there have been precisely [0 recorded cases](https://animalvivid.com/do-penguins-attack-humans/) of a human being killed by a penguin. That doesn't mean it can't happen though.

They may not have a taste of humans, but they have sharp, hooked beaks and a mean glare. So, it's easy to image that if they attacked in a horde, they could overwhelm a human.

But how many of them would it take? Sticking only to the most scientific methods, I asked my Art of Data class. Please absorb the following table of the percent chance of a given number of penguins winning a fight against a human:
| # of Penguins | Chance of Winning |
|---------------|-------------------|
| 1             | 7%                |
| 10            | 25%               |
| 25            | 75%               |
| 50            | 99%               |

By graphing these numbers, we can derive an equation of the line of best fit to determine how the chance of the penguins winning grows for each additional penguin.
